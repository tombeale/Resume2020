Using JavaScript to make AJAX calls and dynamically update portions of the page is one of my favorite techniques. Add JQuery and JSON into the mix, and nearly anything is possible."

IAG didn\u0027t have a dedicated DB Analyst, so I ended up doing a lot of database installs and configuration.\nAt Merrill Corp. I created and edited a lot of stored procedures which were used in the legacy product and the file interfaces to pull data from customer-provided text files and save it to the database. The product dealt with large volumes of insurance data and I often had to find ways to optimize the stored procedures to improve performance."

In practical terms, you can write a client-side function that pulls data from a server without making a round-trip to the server. (Actually it does make a round trip, but as far as your web page is concerned, it was a client-side call).\nThe name is actually a bit deceptive. AJAX is an acronym for Asynchronous Javascript And XML, however AJAX calls do not have to be asynchronous (your code does not wait for the result), nor does it have to return XML, and it can be done in a language other than JavaScript \u2013 I originally used the technique in server-side VB at Corillian to retrieve check images and online banking statements via SOAP calls over a VPN.
